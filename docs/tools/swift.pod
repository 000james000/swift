swift - the amazingly new programming language

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<swift> [B<-c>|B<-S>|B<-i>] B<-sdk=>I<SDK-path> B<-g>
  [B<-O0>|B<-O1>|B<-O2>|B<-O3>]
  B<-o> I<output-file>
  I<input-filenames>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Swift> is a new, high performance systems programming language.  It has a clean
and modern syntax, and offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code
and frameworks, and is memory safe (by default).

Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a
C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core
features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level
constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics.  Swift embraces
modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.
