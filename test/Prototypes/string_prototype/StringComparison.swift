// Implementation-side, boils down to 4 general levels of comparision. These are
// presented from fastest (and most restricively applicable) to slowest (and
// most generally applicable), and thus in the order of preference if possible.
//
//  1) bitwise comparison: compare bits; roughly equivalent to C's memcmp.
//
//  2) zero-extend and compare: zero extend the smaller code unit and then
//  compare bits. Done using a lazy zero-extending view over the smaller-
//  bitwidth string.
//
//  3) scalar value comparison: compare the unicode scalar values, and compare
//  those. This is a decode-and-then-bit-compare. Implemented through a
//  transcoded view targeting (valid?) UTF32.
//
//  4) normalized scalar comparison: compare sequence of normalized scalar
//  values. Currently implemented as grapheme-based comparison (requiring
//  grapheme break logic which currently uses libICU), but that does more work
//  than strictly necessary. Need to make a normalized view, then we can just
//  compare across that. Fast path: so long as the next CUs begin a new
//  grapheme, can compare non-normalized: scalars as above and corresponding
//  fast-paths from above.
//


//
// TODO: notion of mutually-bitwise-comparable encodings, wherein strings in
// these encodings can be ordered through bitwise comparison alone. I need a
// better name, as this notion needs to be paired with NFT. This
// happens when the encodings are the same, or when they have the same bitsize
// and each of their contents are mutually-trivially-decodable.
//

//  TODO: notion of a equivalence-class-break, or a code unit that is definitely
// part of a different ...comparison unit?... than the one preceeding it. All
// grapheme breaks are equivalence-class-breaks, but some additional unicode
// scalars are as well...
//
//
//
// When they apply:
//
//  #1 can be used on entire strings when all of the following are satisfied:
//    * Both strings are in NFT
//    * Both strings have trivially-decodable code units //are mutually-bitwise-comparable
//
//  #2 can be used on entire strings when all of the following are satisfied:
//    * Both strings are in NFT
//    * Both strings have trivially-decodable code units //are mutually-bitwise-comparable
//
//  #3 can be used on entire strings when all of the following are satisfied:
//    * Both strings are in NFT
//
//  #4 is used for all the rest.
//
//  Note that this is a property of comparing two particular strings in two
//  particular encodings. The faster methods can situationally be used for
//  comparing segments of strings when some conditions are satisfied.
//
//
//
// Fast paths
//
// #1 needs no fast paths, it *is* the fastest path.
//
// #2 needs no fast paths. If #1 isn't possible, then #2 *is* the fastest path.
//
// #3 can do bitwise/zero-extension compare whenever both compared code units
//    are trivially-decodable.
//
// #4 can do bitwise/zero-extension compare whenever both compared code units
// are trivially-decodable AND the following code units are definitely
// normalization-sequence-starters.
//


//
// For the slow path, ideally we would have a normalized-scalar-view that we can
// iterate over to compare. Ideally, this would be done without needing to call
// out to ICU, but I don't know if we'd need full grapheme-break detection.
// Regardless, we'd need significant portions of the UCD bundled with the stdlib
// to avoid ICU.
//
// I mock up this functionality using Character and then stable-sorting
// constintuent scalars, but this is not necessarily producing a C normal form.
// I perform composition yet...
//

//
// String sort order in Swift, absent any locale, is the sort order of the
// string's sequence of NFT unicode scalar values.
