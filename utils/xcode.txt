Xcode support for Swift is provided by the IDELanguageSupport project, found here:

	git+ssh://dull.apple.com/git/IDELanguageSupport.git

This project should be checked out alongside other Xcode repository folders (Mac/, iOS/, etc.). If you want just basic support (enough to compile and run), you can follow these steps:

	1. Check out the IDELanguageSupport project by itself.
	2. Build the "XCLanguageSupport" target.
	3. Place the resulting xcplugin in "~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins", creating that directory if necessary.
	4. Relaunch Xcode.
	5. Set the SWIFT_EXEC and SWIFT_LIBRARY_PATH build settings to point to your built compiler and the directory containing the Swift runtime libraries.

There are currently no prebuilt versions of Xcode that support Swift.
