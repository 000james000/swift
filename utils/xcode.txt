Xcode support for Swift is provided by the IDELanguageSupport project, found here:

	git+ssh://dull.apple.com/git/IDELanguageSupport.git

This project should be checked out alongside other Xcode repository folders (Mac/, iOS/, etc.). If you want just basic support (enough to compile and run), you can follow these steps:

	1. Check out the IDELanguageSupport project by itself.
	2. Edit the "ExecPath" setting in "Swift.xcspec" to point to your built compiler.
	3. Build the "XCLanguageSupport" target.
	4. Place the resulting xcplugin in "~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins", creating that directory if necessary.

There are currently no prebuilt versions of Xcode that support Swift.
