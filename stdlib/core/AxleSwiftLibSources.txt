# This file lists the sources for the swift standard library in a
# common place that can be used by both CMake and Make.  It should
# always begin with a comment.  Filenames should not contain spaces
# and should be listed one-per-line.  Comments, which are ignored,
# begin with "#" and extend to the end of the line.
